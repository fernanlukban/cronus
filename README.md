# Cronus, a group time-keeping app

## Things you will need
* python-3.7
* a postgresql server
* time and patience

## Getting started
1. Create a pyenv environment. I currently use python 3.7.2 for this project. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required packages.
2. Edit the alembic.ini file with your own postgres server.
